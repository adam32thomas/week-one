## Description


This repository is the first module project in The Ohio State University coding boot camp program for 2022.  The purpose of the project is to apply best practices in semantic 
html structure and css styling for a fictional company's homepage.  During this project I made several mistakes, back tracked several times, but ultimately gained a higher 
comfort level with the git commit/git push process, html and css.

## Installation

This is a very basic page and no specific instructions should be required here.

## Usage

While I am still learning and unsure of what specific usage requirements might be appropriate to show, the screenshot of this project as it displayed on my local browser
included below:
